These contracts allow for creating on-chain nft media editions.

They include Zora cryptomedia features such as the ability to update canonical urls and include content hashes.

They can be minted by the owner or an arbitary set of addresses â€“ Sales contracts are coming soon.

There are two flavors of contracts
1. SingleEditionMintable (+ SingleEditionMintableCreator factory contract)
